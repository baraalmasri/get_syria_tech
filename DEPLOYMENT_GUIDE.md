## Prerequisites

Before beginning the deployment process, ensure you have access to the following resources and accounts. These prerequisites are essential for a successful deployment and ongoing operation of the e-commerce platform.

### Required Accounts and Services

You will need an active Digital Ocean account with sufficient credits or payment methods configured for creating and maintaining a virtual private server. The recommended droplet size for this application is at least 2GB RAM and 1 CPU core, though 4GB RAM is preferred for optimal performance under load.

A domain name registration is required, specifically the fromsyria.tech domain mentioned in the project requirements. Ensure you have administrative access to the domain's DNS settings through your domain registrar's control panel. You will need to configure DNS records to point to your Digital Ocean server's IP address.

Stripe account setup is crucial for payment processing functionality. You will need both test and live API keys from Stripe, including publishable keys, secret keys, and webhook endpoints. Ensure your Stripe account is fully verified and capable of processing payments in your target markets.

### Development Environment Requirements

A local development environment with Git installed is necessary for code management and deployment. You should have SSH key pairs generated for secure server access, and familiarity with command-line operations on Linux systems will be beneficial throughout the deployment process.

Access to email services for application notifications is recommended. This could be through Gmail, SendGrid, or other SMTP providers. The application will use email for user registration confirmations, password resets, and order notifications.

### Technical Knowledge Prerequisites

Basic understanding of Linux system administration, including file permissions, service management, and package installation, will be helpful. Familiarity with Django applications, database management, and web server configuration will make the deployment process more straightforward.

Knowledge of DNS configuration, SSL certificate management, and basic security practices for web applications will ensure you can maintain and secure the platform effectively after deployment.

## Digital Ocean Server Setup

The first step in deploying your e-commerce platform involves creating and configuring a Digital Ocean droplet that will serve as your production server. This process requires careful consideration of server specifications, security settings, and initial configuration to ensure optimal performance and security.

### Creating the Droplet

Log into your Digital Ocean account and navigate to the "Create" menu, selecting "Droplets" to begin the server creation process. Choose Ubuntu 22.04 LTS as your operating system, as this provides the most stable and well-supported environment for Django applications. The Long Term Support designation ensures you will receive security updates and support for an extended period.

For server specifications, select a droplet with at least 2GB of RAM and 1 CPU core. However, for better performance, especially during peak traffic periods, consider upgrading to 4GB RAM and 2 CPU cores. The additional resources will provide better response times and allow for more concurrent users without performance degradation.

Choose a datacenter region that is geographically closest to your target audience. If your primary customers are in the Middle East, consider selecting a European datacenter such as Amsterdam or Frankfurt for optimal latency. The choice of datacenter can significantly impact page load times for your customers.

### SSH Key Configuration

During droplet creation, configure SSH key authentication rather than using password-based authentication. If you haven't already generated SSH keys, create them on your local machine using the ssh-keygen command. Upload your public key to Digital Ocean during the droplet creation process to enable secure, password-less access to your server.

SSH key authentication provides significantly better security than password authentication, as it eliminates the risk of brute force attacks against weak passwords. Ensure you keep your private key secure and never share it with unauthorized individuals.

### Initial Server Configuration

Once your droplet is created, you will receive an IP address that you can use to connect to your server. Use SSH to connect to your server as the root user initially, then immediately create a non-root user account for day-to-day operations. Running applications as root poses significant security risks and should be avoided.

Create a new user account with sudo privileges using the adduser command, then add this user to the sudo group. This approach follows the principle of least privilege, ensuring that administrative tasks require explicit elevation while normal operations run with limited permissions.

Configure the server's hostname to something meaningful, such as "fromsyria-production" or similar. This helps with server identification and logging. Update the system packages to ensure you have the latest security patches and software versions before proceeding with application-specific installations.

### Firewall Configuration

Digital Ocean provides cloud firewalls, but it's also important to configure the local firewall on your server using UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall). Initially, allow SSH access on port 22, HTTP on port 80, and HTTPS on port 443. These are the minimum ports required for web application operation.

Be cautious when configuring firewall rules, as incorrect settings can lock you out of your server. Always ensure SSH access remains available before applying restrictive firewall rules. Consider setting up fail2ban to automatically block IP addresses that show suspicious activity patterns.

The firewall configuration should be restrictive by default, only allowing necessary traffic. This approach minimizes the attack surface and provides better security for your e-commerce platform, which will handle sensitive customer data and payment information.


## Domain Configuration

Proper domain configuration is essential for making your e-commerce platform accessible to customers and ensuring SSL certificates can be properly issued. The fromsyria.tech domain requires specific DNS records to point to your Digital Ocean server and enable various services.

### DNS Record Configuration

Access your domain registrar's DNS management interface and configure the following DNS records to point to your Digital Ocean droplet's IP address. Create an A record for the root domain (fromsyria.tech) pointing to your server's IP address. Additionally, create a CNAME record for the www subdomain (www.fromsyria.tech) pointing to the root domain.

The A record configuration should use a TTL (Time To Live) of 300 seconds initially, which allows for quick changes during the setup process. Once everything is working correctly, you can increase the TTL to 3600 seconds or higher for better performance and reduced DNS query load.

Consider adding additional DNS records for future expansion, such as mail records if you plan to use custom email addresses with your domain. An MX record pointing to your email provider's servers will enable email functionality using your domain name.

### SSL Certificate Preparation

Before requesting SSL certificates, ensure your domain is properly propagating and pointing to your server. Use tools like dig or nslookup to verify that DNS resolution is working correctly from multiple locations. DNS propagation can take up to 48 hours, though it typically completes within a few hours.

Let's Encrypt will be used for SSL certificate generation, providing free, automated certificates that are trusted by all major browsers. The certificate authority requires domain validation, which involves proving you control the domain by responding to challenges served from your web server.

Prepare for certificate renewal automation, as Let's Encrypt certificates expire every 90 days. The certbot tool provides automatic renewal capabilities that can be configured to run via cron jobs, ensuring your certificates remain valid without manual intervention.

### Subdomain Planning

Consider your future expansion plans when configuring DNS records. You might want to add subdomains for different services, such as api.fromsyria.tech for API endpoints, admin.fromsyria.tech for administrative access, or blog.fromsyria.tech for content marketing.

Planning subdomain structure early allows for better organization and security segmentation. Each subdomain can have its own SSL certificate and security policies, providing flexibility for future development and service expansion.

## Application Deployment

The application deployment process involves transferring your Django e-commerce platform to the production server, configuring the environment, and ensuring all components work together seamlessly. This section provides detailed instructions for each step of the deployment process.

### Code Repository Setup

Begin by setting up a Git repository for your Django application if you haven't already done so. Create a repository on GitHub, GitLab, or another Git hosting service, and push your complete application code to the repository. Ensure that sensitive information such as secret keys and database passwords are not included in the repository.

The repository should include all necessary files for deployment, including the Django application code, requirements.txt file, deployment scripts, configuration files, and documentation. Organize the repository structure logically with clear separation between application code, configuration files, and deployment resources.

Configure the repository with appropriate access controls, ensuring that only authorized personnel can access the code. If using a private repository, set up SSH keys or access tokens for the production server to pull code updates during deployment.

### Server Code Deployment

Connect to your production server via SSH and navigate to the directory where you will deploy the application. The recommended location is /var/www/phone_shop, which follows standard conventions for web application deployment on Linux systems.

Clone the Git repository to the server using the git clone command. If using a private repository, ensure that SSH keys or access tokens are properly configured for authentication. The cloning process will download all application files to the server.

Set appropriate file permissions for the application directory, ensuring that the web server user has read access to application files while maintaining security by preventing unauthorized modifications. The application user should own the files, with the web server group having read access.

### Virtual Environment Configuration

Create a Python virtual environment within the application directory to isolate the application's dependencies from system packages. This approach prevents conflicts and makes dependency management more reliable and predictable.

Activate the virtual environment and install all required Python packages using the requirements.txt file. This process may take several minutes as packages are downloaded and compiled. Monitor the installation process for any errors that might indicate missing system dependencies.

Verify that all packages are installed correctly by importing key modules and checking version numbers. Pay particular attention to database adapters, web server interfaces, and payment processing libraries, as these are critical for application functionality.

### Environment Configuration

Create a production environment configuration file (.env) based on the provided template. This file contains sensitive configuration data such as database passwords, API keys, and security tokens that should not be stored in the code repository.

Configure database connection parameters, including hostname, database name, username, and password. Ensure that these credentials match the PostgreSQL configuration you set up earlier. Test the database connection to verify that the Django application can successfully connect to PostgreSQL.

Set up Stripe API keys for payment processing, including both publishable and secret keys. Use test keys initially to verify that the payment integration works correctly, then switch to live keys when ready for production use. Configure webhook endpoints for receiving payment status updates from Stripe.

Configure email settings for sending notifications to customers and administrators. This includes SMTP server settings, authentication credentials, and sender addresses. Test email functionality to ensure that registration confirmations and order notifications are delivered successfully.

### Database Migration and Setup

Run Django database migrations to create the necessary database tables and indexes for your e-commerce platform. The migration process will create tables for products, categories, users, orders, and other application data.

Create a Django superuser account for administrative access to the platform. This account will allow you to access the Django admin interface and manage products, categories, and orders. Choose a strong password and keep the credentials secure.

Load initial data into the database, including product categories, sample products, and any other reference data needed for the platform to function. You can use Django fixtures or management commands to populate the database with initial content.

Verify database setup by accessing the Django admin interface and confirming that all models are properly created and accessible. Test basic functionality such as creating products, categories, and user accounts to ensure the database is working correctly.

### Static Files Configuration

Configure static file handling for production use. Django's collectstatic command gathers all static files from various applications and places them in a single directory for efficient serving by the web server.

Run the collectstatic command to collect all CSS, JavaScript, and image files used by the application. This process creates a staticfiles directory containing all assets needed for the frontend interface.

Configure Nginx to serve static files directly, bypassing the Django application for better performance. Static file serving by Nginx is much more efficient than serving through Django, especially for images, stylesheets, and JavaScript files.

Test static file serving by accessing the application through a web browser and verifying that all styles, scripts, and images load correctly. Check the browser's developer tools for any missing resources or loading errors.

### Application Service Configuration

Configure the Django application to run as a system service using systemd. This approach ensures that the application starts automatically when the server boots and restarts automatically if it crashes.

Create a systemd service file that defines how the application should be started, stopped, and monitored. The service file should specify the user account, working directory, environment variables, and command line for starting the application.

Enable and start the systemd service, then verify that the application is running correctly by checking the service status and reviewing log files. The application should start without errors and be accessible through the configured port.

Configure log rotation to prevent log files from consuming excessive disk space. Set up logrotate rules that archive old log files and delete very old logs to maintain system performance and disk space availability.

### Web Server Configuration

Configure Nginx as a reverse proxy to forward requests to the Django application while serving static files directly. This configuration provides better performance and security compared to serving the application directly.

Create an Nginx server block configuration that defines how requests should be handled, including SSL settings, static file locations, and proxy parameters. The configuration should include security headers and performance optimizations.

Test the Nginx configuration using the nginx -t command to verify that there are no syntax errors or configuration problems. Reload Nginx to apply the new configuration and verify that the application is accessible through the web server.

Configure Nginx logging to capture access logs and error logs for monitoring and troubleshooting purposes. Set up log rotation for Nginx logs to prevent disk space issues and maintain system performance.
